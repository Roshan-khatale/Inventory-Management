# Inventory-Management
This project is a Python-based inventory management service that uses the Pandas library to manage and analyze inventory data. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and efficient solution for tracking inventory levels, making purchase orders, and managing supplier information.
The service is designed to work with a database of products that are stored in a CSV file. The CSV file contains information about each product, including the product name, ID, description, price, and quantity. The Pandas library is used to read and manipulate the data in the CSV file, allowing the user to add, edit, and remove products as needed.
The user interface for the inventory management service is built using the Flask web framework. The user can access the inventory data through a web browser, where they can view, search, and sort the data. The web interface also allows the user to generate purchase orders for products that are running low on stock. The purchase order is automatically generated and sent to the supplier via email.
In addition to managing inventory levels, the service also provides analysis tools to help the user make informed decisions about their inventory. The user can generate reports that show which products are selling the most, which products are not selling, and which products are running low on stock. The reports are generated using the Pandas library and can be exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
Overall, this project provides a simple and effective solution for managing inventory levels and supplier information. The use of the Pandas library allows for efficient data manipulation and analysis, while the Flask web framework provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and interacting with the data. The project can be customized and extended to meet the specific needs of the user, making it a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.
